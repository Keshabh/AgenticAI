**LangGraph Agentic AI Tutorial – Key Terminology & Descriptions**

- **LangGraph**:  
  An open-source Python framework for building workflows with multiple AI agents that can communicate and decide together.

- **AI Agent**:  
  A software bot that can act autonomously and use tools or APIs to complete one task.

- **Agentic AI**:  
  A system with several AI agents working together—making plans, talking to each other, and solving complex problems as a team.

- **Node**:  
  A piece of code or function that does one job in the workflow.

- **Edge**:  
  The connection between nodes, controlling the flow of steps (can include conditions for branching).

- **State**:  
  A data structure or dictionary that holds all information as it passes through nodes—like shared memory.

- **State Graph**:  
  The entire workflow, visualized as a connected set of nodes and edges.

- **Conditional Routing**:  
  Paths in the workflow change based on decisions/data (e.g. “if X > 3, go to node A; else node B”).

- **Workflow**:  
  A sequence of steps (nodes) and decisions (edges) to complete a task from start to finish.

- **Compile/Visualize**:  
  Turning your code into a visual graph so you can see and check the whole process.

- **Autonomous workflow**:  
  The workflow runs end-to-end with agents making choices, requiring little or no manual input.

- **Modularity**:  
  You can add, change, or remove agents and steps easily without breaking the entire workflow.

- **Production Ready**:  
  Stable enough to use for real-world, business-critical projects.

- **Real-world Examples**:  
  Automating report generation, chatbot handling, or end-to-end blog creation using agentic workflows.

- **Learning Path**:  
  Start with simple agent graphs, then add complexity—more agents, steps, and smart branching as needed.

*This format is ideal for adding to a README.md as a glossary or quick reference for anyone new to LangGraph and agentic AI.*
